not accept missing values encoded as NaN natively. For supervised learning, you might want to consider sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier and Regressor which accept missing values encoded as NaNs natively. Alternatively, it is possible to preprocess the data, for instance by using an imputer transformer in a pipeline or drop samples with missing values. See https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html You can find a list of all estimators that handle NaN values at the following page: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html#estimators-that-handle-nan-values\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#print best parameters\n","grid_search_dt.best_params_"],"metadata":{"id":"PVhLU5MulpQm"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#best mean cross-validated score schieved during search\n","grid_search_dt.best_score_"],"metadata":{"id":"Uw8hkO1OlsvO"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Performance Metric Functions"],"metadata":{"id":"7P5b0RzUeHFe"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#performance metrics\n","\n","# show metrics\n","def show_metrics():\n","    tp = cm[1,1]\n","    fn = cm[1,0]\n","    fp = cm[0,1]\n","    tn = cm[0,0]\n","    print('Accuracy  =     {:.3f}'.format((tp+tn)/(tp+tn+fp+fn)))\n","    print('Precision =     {:.3f}'.format(tp/(tp+fp)))\n","    print('Recall    =     {:.3f}'.format(tp/(tp+fn)))\n","    print('F1_score  =     {:.3f}'.format(2*(((tp/(tp+fp))*(tp/(tp+fn)))/\n","                                                 ((tp/(tp+fp))+(tp/(tp+fn))))))\n","\n","#plotting learning curve\n","def plot_learning_curve(estimator, title, X, y, ylim = None, cv = None,\n","                        n_jobs = 1, train_sizes = np.linspace(.1, 1.0, 5)):\n","    plt.figure()\n","    plt.title(title)\n","    if ylim is not None:\n","        plt.ylim(*ylim)\n","    plt.xlabel('Training examples')\n","    plt.ylabel('Score')\n","    train_sizes, train_scores, test_scores = learning_curve(\n","        estimator, X, y, cv = cv, n_jobs = n_jobs, train_sizes = train_sizes)\n","    train_scores_mean = np.mean(train_scores, axis = 1)\n","    train_scores_std = np.std(train_scores, axis = 1)\n","    test_scores_mean = np.mean(test_scores, axis = 1)\n","    test_scores_std = np.std(test_scores, axis = 1)\n","    plt.grid()\n","    plt.fill_between(train_sizes, train_scores_mean -
